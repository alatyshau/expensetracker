Could you write me a Expense Tracker web application where:
 - User must be able to create an account and log in
 - When logged in, user can see and edit expenses he entered
 - When entered, each expense has Date, Time, Description, Amount, Comment
 - User can filter expenses
 - User can print expenses per week with total amount, and average day spending
 - Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
 - I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
 not an option.
 - REST API â€“ for all entities
 - You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
 - As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.
